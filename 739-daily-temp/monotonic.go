// One famous monotonic stack interview question is the sunset view problem.
// In this problem, youâ€™re given an array of buildings,
// where each building is represented by its height.
// The buildings are in line with each other,
// meaning that if one building is taller than the other,
// they will be blocked from seeing the sunset.
// The sun sets to the right side.
// Your goal is to find all the buildings that can see the sunset.
